# Assignment4AI

For this project we wanted to create a AI Reader which could:
1. Take speech input
2. Convert speech to text
3. Have a trained parser analyse the text and figure out the intent of the sentence/words
4. By analysing the text, figuring out what the system should do, based on input.
  This could be to do any Smart Home related tasks, using different APIs to access information like 
  weather information, closest store, restaurant etc.
5. Execute the task and present it to user. 

See the pdf for more information.
